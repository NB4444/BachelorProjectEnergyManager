# Meeting

I should be able to finish between october - december (september if I work harder).

## Internship

There will be a talk next week at friday.

## Research goal

The goal is to investigate GPU power usage patterns and determine what the opportunities to act are to conserve power and how much control we have over power usage during those opportunities.
To do so I should investigate the relation between GPU usage patterns and power usage.

## Literature

Find literature about GPU (and CPU) frequency scaling and power capping.
Power capping will slow the application only if its power usage is higher than cap in order to stay within power constraints.
The amount of slowdown and the height of the cap are not related.

Focus on these questions:

- What has been done about frequency scaling and power capping on GPUs?
- Look for applications with different interacting patterns between the CPU and GPU (look at benchmarks).

Potentially share the list of papers with Ana using Mendeley.

Ana has another student's bachelor thesis that could be useful.
She told me to look at the observations that were made, namely that GPU idling is expensive.

## Application profiling tool

There is a GPU monitoring tool that can be run locally to investigate GPU power usage.
It uses [Nvidia's System Management Interface](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface) to determine power usage.
Its documentation can be found in its README file.
