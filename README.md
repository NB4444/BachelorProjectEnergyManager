This repository contains the files for the collaboration project between EAR and SARA on power saving methods for GPU
kernels.
EnergyManager is a framework that can be used to test and monitor heterogeneous CPU-GPU applications in order
to automatically apply energy saving strategies.

## Usage

To use the framework, build the project using cmake.
