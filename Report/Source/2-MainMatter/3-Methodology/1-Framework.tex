\section{Framework}
	The first step in the process of investigating energy consumption and designing energy saving strategies is to set up a framework that can be used to benchmark applications that represent various workload types using different inputs and record the results somewhere for investigation.
	Therefore, I designed a framework capable of running applications, monitoring application energy consumption and performance characteristics, determining application workload types and automatically applying energy saving strategies based on the detected workload types.
	This section outlines the features of the framework as well as the reasoning behind the most important design decisions.
