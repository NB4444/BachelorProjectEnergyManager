\chapter{Background}
	This chapter outlines some of the research and other resources that are relevant to the topic of \gls{gpu} energy conservation.

	\section{Energy Consumption}
		This section outlines some of the work that has been done to measure and predict energy consumption.

		\subsection{Measuring}
			Measuring live energy consumption is an important aspect of many power saving strategies.
			There exist tools that can perform these types of measurement, the most important of which are outlined in this section.

			\subsubsection{NVIDIA \acrlong{smi}}
				NVIDIA's \gls{smi} tool is a command line utility that is able to query the \gls{gpu} device state \parencite{NVIDIA}.
				Support is limited to NVIDIA \glspl{gpu}.
				What makes this tool useful to this research is the fact that it can retrieve the current power consumption from the \gls{gpu} as it is running and that it can output this information to the console, which makes it possible to easily integrate the output programmatically.

		\subsection{Statistical Analysis and Prediction}
			\textcite{Ma2009} developed a method to statistically analyze and model the power consumption of a mainstream \gls{gpu}.
			To achieve this they make use of the fact that there exists an innate coupling among the power consumption characteristics, runtime performance and dynamic workloads.
			They found that their model is capable of robustly and accurately predicting the power consumption of a target \gls{gpu}.
