abstract = {In recent years, more and more transistors have been integrated within the GPU, which has resulted in steadily rising power consumption requirements. In this paper we present a preliminary scheme to statistically analyze and model the power consumption of amainstream GPU (NVidia GeForce 8800gt) by exploiting the innate coupling among power consumption characteristics, runtime performance, and dynamic workloads. Based on the recorded run-time GPU workload signals, our trained statistical model is capable of robustly and accurately predict- ing power consumption of the target GPU. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first work that applies statistical analysis to model the power consumption of a mainstream GPU, and its results provide useful insights for future endeavors of building energy-efficient GPU computing paradigms.},

abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as a promising platform for parallel computation. With a large number of scalar processors and abundant memory bandwidth, GPUs provide substantial computation power. While delivering high computation performance, the GPU also consumes high power and needs to be equipped with sufficient power supplies and cooling systems. Therefore, it is essential to institute an efficient mechanism for evaluating and understanding the power consumption requirement when running real applications on high-end GPUs. In this paper, we present a high-level GPU power consumption model using sophisticated tree-based random forest methods which can correlate the power consumption with a set of independent performance variables. This statistical model not only predicts the GPU runtime power consumption accurately, but more importantly, it also provides sufficient insights for understanding the dependence between the GPU runtime power consumption and the individual performance metrics. In order to gain more insights, we use a GPU simulator that can collect more runtime performance metrics than hardware counters. We measure the power consumption of a wide-range of CUDA kernels on an experimental system with GTX 280 GPU as statistical samples for our power analysis. This methodology can certainly be applied to any other CUDA GPU. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},
