# Meeting

- Measure a simple matrix multiply application statically (no power saving input)
	- Different frequency levels, same application
	- Monitor performance variables
	- See which frequency level saves the most power
- Discuss FLOPS/watt usage
- Discuss whether we measure a minute of runtime or a total amount of work
	- Fixes homogeneity issues
- Prepare presentation
	- Start from the beginning
	- Simple google docs presentation
	- Simple demonstration
- Add README to the repository
